Then, access the Github repository. Fork the repository and rename it to [your GitHub username].github.io Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/[your GitHub username]/[your GitHub username].github.io.git Website personalization Once you have cloned the repository, open the project in Visual Studio Code or your preferred text editor. Modify the config.yaml file and set baseURL = https://[your github username].github.io. Choose the languages you want to use for the website Customize the template to suit your needs. You can use YAML files in the /data directory for the portfolio page and create blog articles in the /content/posts . Visualize your website locally with the following command hugo server -D Deployment in Github Pages Ensure that your repository name is [your GitHub username].github.io Create a gh-pages branch typing the following command : git checkout -b gh-pages Push the gh-pages branch to Github : git push origin gh-pages Check if the template provides a workflow in .github/workflows/deploy-site.yaml for automated deployments using GitHub Actions.

In this article, I\u0026rsquo;ll walk you through the steps I followed to bring this project to life.\nStep 1: Gathering Reference image To start, I began by capturing reference photos of my guitar from both side and front angles. I then removed the background of these images using Photoshop and put them as background images on x and y axis in Blender.\nStep 2: Setting Up Background Images With my reference images prepared, I imported them into Blender and positioned them as background images on both the X and Y axes. These images served as blueprints, helping me maintain the accurate proportions and details of the guitar throughout the modeling process.\nStep 3: Modeling the Guitar The core of this project was modeling the guitar\u0026rsquo;s intricate shape. I began by using Blender\u0026rsquo;s Knife tool to outline the guitar\u0026rsquo;s body on a plane. Afterward, I extruded and adjusted vertices to match the contours and dimensions of the reference images. Moving on to the neck and headstock, I created these components using cube primitives. I then proceeded to model other components such as the head, bridge, strings, and smaller details like the rosette, pickguard, and tuners.\nStep 4: Applying Textures Once satisfied with the 3D structure, I shifted my attention to applying textures to the model. I used the reference pictures to ensure the textures were authentically replicated.\nStep 5: Creating the Scene To showcase the 3D guitar effectively, I created a virtual room environment within Blender. Adjusting the lighting and spotlights helped illuminate the guitar in a way that highlighted its details.\nStep 6: Crafting the Animation Finally, to provide a multifaceted view of the guitar, I created a simple camera animation.\n","date":"June 8, 2020","hero":"/images/default-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://melaniebrg.github.io/posts/cg/blender-project/blender/","summary":"For my Blender class project, I took on the challenge of creating a 3D model of my Taylor 510ce guitar.
