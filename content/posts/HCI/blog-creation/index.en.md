As a first assigment of Human Computer Interface, we had to create a Blog to showcase the work we will do during our master. I created my website using Hugo, a fast and modern static site generator. 



- blog `author.yaml` 

- Hugo installation

I downloaded a hugo theme 
https://themes.gohugo.io


- deploy
