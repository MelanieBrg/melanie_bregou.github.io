For my Blender class project, I took on the challenge of creating a 3D model of my Taylor 510ce guitar. In this article, I'll walk you through the steps I followed to bring this project to life.

#### Step 1: Gathering Reference image
To start, I began by capturing reference photos of my guitar from both side and front angles.

I then removed the background of these images using Photoshop and put them as background images on x and y axis in Blender.




#### Step 2: Setting Up Background Images
With my reference images prepared, I imported them into Blender and positioned them as background images on both the X and Y axes. These images served as blueprints, helping me maintain the accurate proportions and details of the guitar throughout the modeling process.

#### Step 3: Modeling the Guitar
The core of this project was modeling the guitar's intricate shape. I began by using Blender's Knife tool to outline the guitar's body on a plane. Afterward, I extruded and adjusted vertices to match the contours and dimensions of the reference images.
Moving on to the neck and headstock, I created these components using cube primitives.
I then proceeded to model other components such as the head, bridge, strings, and smaller details like the rosette, pickguard, and tuners.

#### Step 4: Applying Textures
Once satisfied with the 3D structure, I shifted my attention to applying textures to the model. I used the reference pictures to ensure the textures were authentically replicated. 


#### Step 5: Creating the Scene
To showcase the 3D guitar effectively, I created a virtual room environment within Blender. Adjusting the lighting and spotlights helped illuminate the guitar in a way that highlighted its details.

#### Step 6: Crafting the Animation
Finally, to provide a multifaceted view of the guitar, I created a simple camera animation.
